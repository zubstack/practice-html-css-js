    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p> Calling a recipe "the best" is always a risky proposition, since these things are purely subjective; so what I really should have called this is, "What Chef John Thinks is the Best Barbecue Baked Beans."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dried red beans</li>
        <li>3 quarts water </li>
        <li>1 bay leaf </li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped </li>
        <li>1 cup barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>⅓ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons molasses</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add dry beans to a bowl, cover with water, and let soak for 8 hours, or overnight.

        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>Drain beans and transfer to a large pot filled with 3 quarts of cold, fresh water. Add bay leaf, pork shoulder, and onion. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir. Skim off foam if desired. Let simmer until beans are just tender, about 1 hour.

        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>While beans simmer, combine barbecue sauce, ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, molasses, mustard, Worcestershire, smoked paprika, cayenne, black pepper, kosher salt, and garlic powder in a bowl with a whisk. Set aside until needed.

        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>
            Transfer tender bean mixture to a deep, 15x10-inch baking dish using a spider strainer. Pour in barbecue sauce mixture and 2 ½ cups of the bean cooking liquid. Place bacon slices on top.

        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>Bake uncovered in the center of the preheated oven until the liquids have reduced into a thick sauce, 2 to 3 hours.

        </li>
    </ol>
